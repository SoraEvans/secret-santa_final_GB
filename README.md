# Secret Santa

### Point of the project: 
Secret Santa is a popular New Year's activity with simple rules: each participant tries on the role of a “Secret Santa” and anonymously prepares a gift for another randomly selected participant.
Taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of existing similar services, we have created our own unique convenient online platform for the anonymous exchange of New Year's gifts within the framework of this game.

#### Stack: React, react-router-dom, Styled-components, MUI, MomentJS, REST API
#### Project: https://secret-santa-1.netlify.app
